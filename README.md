# Game Snake

Do you want to improve your programming logic without relying on frameworks? I have noticed that many of my colleagues struggle to carry out their developments if there is no library (NuGet, Plugin, Component, Package, etc.) that does exactly what is expected as the final result, and this can sometimes be frustrating. Donâ€™t get me wrong, libraries are valuable tools, but many times, a development that could be simple becomes complicated due to the eagerness to save work and effort.

I will demonstrate that with just basic concepts, you can build something amazing. Using a matrix (or a two-dimensional array), we will create a Snake game, from the game engine to the rendering of the image displayed on the screen, and we will also add sounds.
